## Front Matter
You can add some metadata for the special article by add some YAML within `---` three dashes at the top of the markdown file, these contents call Front Matter.

::TipBox{type="announce"}
We won't see this metadata after the markdown file convert to the website page. So you shouldn't worry about the "dirty" header will make the article in a mess.

It is written in a special format called [YAML or YML](https://yaml.org/), this format is make up of a list of `key: value` pairs.
